# Getting Started
Once you login/signup to Gameshare, you can visit the game index page to view the details of certain games as well as all the other users on the site who play said game.

You can then add games to your own profile so that you appear in the user list for the game as well, allowing others to find you.

# Next Steps
- Make a submission form for games that aren't on the site yet or connect to databases to retrieve game details.
- Include a search function for games and users.
- Fix chat feature so it works.
- Make space for users to show off their in-game exploits.
